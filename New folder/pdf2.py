# Interview-Style Questions Based on Conditional Statements
# 1. Check Even or Odd
# Question: Determine whether a number is even or odd. Explanation: A number is even if it is divisible by 2. Otherwise, it’s odd. - Input: Number = 6 - Output: Even number
num=6
if(num%2==0):
    print("eveen numbers")
else:
    print("odd numbers")

# 2. Divisible by 5 but Not by 10
# Question: Check if a number is divisible by 5 but not by 10. Explanation: Use modulo (%) to check if the number % 5 == 0 and number % 10 != 0. - Input: Number = 25 - Output: Satisfy


# 3. Biggest Among Two Numbers
# Question: Find the biggest number among two. Explanation: Use comparison operators (>) to check which number is greater. - Input: A = 4, B = 7 - Output: Biggest is: 7
